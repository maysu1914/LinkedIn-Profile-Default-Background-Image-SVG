# LinkedIn Default Background Image in SVG Format
It is a SVG file of LinkedIn's default profile background image. I drew it in InkScape.

# Description
You can customize the default LinkedIn style background image with your own favorite colors and may add some texts on it.
You can give your profile page a more material design suitable for new style of LinkedIn.

> ***Critical Note:** Even though you export your image at high resolution, LinkedIn will compress it to look ugly... You can't upload SVG or PNG files, eventually LinkedIn will convert them to highly compressed ugly JPGs...*

# Usage
There are 3 layers in the SVG file:
- "image" contains the image only (ðŸ™„)
- "pofile view" replicate the real profile page (user experience for everyone)
- "feed view" replicate the real feed page (user experience for only author)
- "calculation view" has colorful parts to better position the texts you add by them
